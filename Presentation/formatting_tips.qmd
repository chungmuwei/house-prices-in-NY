## Double "##"

Doube "##" will create a new page which you can fit your content

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

More usage can also be found in Garth's page: <https://github.com/garthtarr/sydney_quarto/blob/main/presentation.qmd>


# A Single "#"
It will create a cover page, and somehow generate a table of content after the title page


## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

## 
If you do not put a name for this section, it will leave the title empty
```{r}
 a = c(1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5)

hist(a)


```
