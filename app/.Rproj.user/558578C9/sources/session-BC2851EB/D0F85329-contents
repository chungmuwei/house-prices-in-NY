# Group Contract

**Group:** CC901E2

**Name:** <ENTER YOUR NAME>

**GitHub link:** <https://github.sydney.edu.au/yzhe2994/CC901E2>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I agree to:

-   Abide by the terms of this contract in relation to the group assessment for DATA2902.

-   Store all my written and code contributions to the assessment in the GitHub repository.

-   Keep a record of my other contributions to the assessment (e.g. discussions, emails, meetings attended). A copy of this may be requested by the coordinator.

-   Abide by the values outlined in the [Student Charter](https://www.sydney.edu.au/policies/showdoc.aspx?recnum=PDOC2011/215&RendNum=0) by working collaboratively with other students, acting with integrity and honesty throughout the working process.

-   Communicate in two main ways: discussions and questions on Facebook messenger and online meetings on Zoom where all members work together. Email and GitHub are other communication sources that can be used.

-   Check Facebook messenger and Email daily, and check GitHub twice a week. When deemed necessary, zoom meetings will be conducted, arranged via Facebook Messenger.

-   Attend labs in the weeks before the tasks are due and maintain a quick review after our lab each week. In addition to this, hold a weekly meeting via zoom for deeper discussion.

I understand that:

-   My agreement to these terms is indicated through the act of submitting this in Canvas.

-   If I fail to meet my obligations as detailed in this group contract then I have failed to meet the assessment requirements for DATA2902 and may be awarded a mark of zero for some or all of the project components.
